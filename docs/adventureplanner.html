                        <p>My team and I leveraged the power of data visualization using Tableau to analyze trends in the problem space. By transforming complex data into compelling visual representations, I was able to uncover hidden patterns and make informed decisions.<br><br>

                            We then conducted think-aloud usability tests with a prominent travel planning product called, Skeema, in order to understand their experiences and identify the issues they faced with existing tools. By actively listening to their feedback, we gained invaluable insights on what issues users had with tools already available.<br><br>
                            
                            To synthesize the feedback received and establish clear guiding principles, we employed affinity clustering. This method allowed us to organize and categorize user pain points into guiding tenets for creating a potential solution. Our key insights included:<br><br>

                                <li>Users possess different ‘travel styles’ which current tools are not flexible enough to cater to all  different user groups.</li>
                                <li>It’s often difficult for users to navigate the information overload and parse through hundreds of recommendations when researching for a trip.</li>
